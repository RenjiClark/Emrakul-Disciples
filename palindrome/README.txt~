Remove this line and use this file to document what you changed to fix
the memory leaks in palindrome. What did you change, and why did you
have to change it? (The "why" here will be at least as important as
the "what".)


Inside palindrome.c str_reverse() callocs some memory. This is never freed, so inside palindrome() we freed the memory used after the variable was done being relevant with this line:
free(rev);


There was still the calloc made inside palindrome() to deal with. We can't free up the memory before or after the return statement, so this was done inside the test file. We declared the result of palindrome() as a variable "palindromeResult" (and not "penguin") so that it could be freed after the assert statement. In both is_palindrome() and not_palindrome() we did this:

  assert_string_equal(palindrome(str), "Yes"); 
became:
  char* palindromeResult = palindrome(str);
  assert_string_equal(palindromeResult, "Yes");  
  free(palindromeResult);

and

  assert_string_equal(palindrome(str), "No"); 
became:
  char* palindromeResult = palindrome(str);
  assert_string_equal(palindromeResult, "No");  
  free(palindromeResult);
